Write a Python Program to merge two lists and sort it.

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of two integers and two lists.

First input consists of size of the first list.

Second inputs corresponds to the elements of the first list.

Third input consists of size of the second list.

Fourth inputs corresponds to the elements of the second list.

Output consists of the sorted elements

Sample Input & Output:

3

1

2

3

3

1

5

6


Sorted list is: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]

solution:
n1=int(input())
ls1=[]
for i in range(n1):
    a=int(input())
    ls1.append(a)
n2=int(input())
ls2=[]
for i in range(n2):
    b=int(input())
    ls2.append(b)
total=ls1+ls2
total.sort()
print("Sorted list is: ",total)
