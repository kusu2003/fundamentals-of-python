Write a program to generate the following series --- 0,2,8,14,...,34 

Input format: 

The input containing an integer which denotes 'n'

Output format: 

Print the series and refer the sample output for formatting.

Sample Input & Output:

5

0 2 8 14 24 

solution:
n=int(input())
a=0
print(a)
for i in range(2,n+1):
    if i%2==0:
        b=i*i-2
        print(b)
    else:
        b=i*i-1
        print(b)
