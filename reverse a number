Write program to reverse a number is discussed here. We can reverse a number using loop and arithmetic operators in both iterative and recursive approaches. 

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of a integer.

Output consists of reversed input.

Sample Input: 

13579

Sample Output: 

97531

solution:
a=int(input())
rev=0
while a!=0:
    b=a%10
    rev=rev*10+b
    a=a//10
print(str(rev))
